          From the Royal University of Phnom Penh’s CJCC, Pathmazing launches Cambodia’s first true eCommerce platform
          to initially focus on the food and beverage sector, and later transportation, hotels, activities and tour
          guides. Our name “Tesjor” is derived from the Khmer word “tourism.”
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          For our launch we focused on the F&B sector. We have signed 85 restaurant outlets and more than 50 outlets
          have been fully trained and ready to start accepting orders today. Some of these restaurants include Domino’s
          Pizza, KFC, Lotteria, Tous Les Jours and Cafe Amazon.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          The Tesjor platform includes an app for customers, an app for the restaurant operator and various web admin
          pages. It’s a true eCommerce platform because it provides an end-to-end digital solution for the entire
          ordering, payment and delivery process. Only e-payment is accepted and cash on delivery (COD) is not an
          option.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">Since Tesjor requires e-payment, we have established strong relationships with all the major
          local payment
          providers. At launch the available e-payment options are Tesjor Wallet, Wing Money, ACLEDA, PayGo kiosks and
          PayWay that includes Visa and Mastercard. Our most important strategic partner is Wing, who will be managing
          our Tesjor Wallet, which is an e-wallet where users can top-up money to be used later to quickly make
          purchases in Tesjor and other eCommerce apps. With the Tesjor Wallet, it’s tied to the Tesjor account. To make
          any purchase, users simply need to enter their Tesjor password.</p>
        <p class="lead">
          Working together with epayment providers, restaurants, hotels, tour guides, tour operators and
          the
          government, we’re well positioned to digitally transform Cambodia’s tourism and hospitality industry into the
          best in the region.
